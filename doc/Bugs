-- Real Problems
#24000: Bug in apt Version: 0.0.17-1bo0
 Summary: Couldn't locate an archive source for a package
 Status: Require Status file. 
#24717: apt dies early if one postinst/preinst dies
 Status: Requires dpkg modifications
#25104: APT should retry failed downloads
 Summary: FTP method has problems with busy servers
 Status: The 0.3.0 ftp method should probably use the configuration mechanism
         to control this desired behavoir.
#25176: Problem with FTP/firewall
#25458: Problem with FTP/firewall
 Summary: FTP method has no controls for firewalls
 Status: The 0.3.0 ftp method should probably use the configuration mechanism
         to control this desired behavoir.
 
-- Fixed but unclosed things
#25026: apt: Why do you list the packages you're _not_ doing anything to instead of the ones you are?
#22507: apt: apt-get - listing packages to be upgraded (wishlist)
 Summary: Feature request 
 Status: Fixed in 0.3.0 via the -u option
#21113: [Apt] In dselect, update dies and exits if the packages file is not found.
 Status: Fixed in 0.3.0
#22675: APT does not honor the --admin-dir option
#22836: Disk/Zip-Method for apt?
 Summary: APT does not provide a way to download packages onto a 
          removable media for another computer
 Status: 0.3.0 has substantially better support for this to the point
         that it is doable by using a separate configuration file and
	 the -c option
#27601: srange errors from dselect
 Summary: Couldn't locate an archive source
 Status: Require status file
         Believed to be fixed in 0.1.9, was not reproducable w/ given 
	 status file
#27841: apt: apt depends on a missing library
 Status: New versions of APT in slink have been compiled with libstdc++2.9
#23984: apt: support for "no_proxy" would be nice
 Status: Planed to be integrated into the new methods via the configuration
         file
	 Done - Use Acquire::http::proxy::host.com="DIRECT"
#25021: apt: Need some control over multiple connections
 Status: Probable that 0.3.x will have support for configuing some
         parameters
	 Done - Use Acquire::Queue-Mode="access"
#25019: apt: Confusing progress report
 Summary: Gripes about the progress meter
 Status: I do not intend to implement very many of these ideas in apt-get. 
         The GUI will naturally be better
	 I think the new progress meter address basically everyone's 
	 concerns.
#25022: apt: Lack of feedback on date checking
 Summary: Wants to know what package files were not updated
 Status: There is no place for this in the current apt-get design,
         probably won't make the GUI either.
	 Wee, the new acquire code allows this, it now prints out 'Hit'
#26019: apt may report wrong line speed
#26433: apt: claims to fetch things it doesn't actually fetch (wishlist)
#28778: apt: apt's fetched message is wrong for update of packages files
 Summary: APT includes the fetch time from the local cache in its
          calculations
 Status: Probably will be fixed with new acquire code
         And it actually was fixed with the new acquire code
#26670: apt: apt-get dumps core after checking integrity
 Summary: Some terminal environments cause APT to crash
          Win95 telnet and emacs term-in-a-buffer are two at least
 Status: I have no idea why.
         Seems to be gone in .3, whatever it was...
#25001: apt: cleaned out archive even though not all files were installed
 Status: Apparently in some cases APT can return a success code even 
         though it failed. I'm paying very close attention to this in
	 0.3.x. Not to mention that the clean behavior will be 
	 configurable..
#28391: apt-get install without upgrading
 Summary: Make install leave the package in the keep state if it is already
          installed
 Status: Will be implemented in 0.3.0
	 Try the --no-upgrade options
#28373: apt package is missing information on ftp.conf
#29293: apt: Docs reference apt(8) but apt(8) not provided.
 Summary: The man pages have references to several non-existent items,
          ftp.conf is only one of them.
 Status: Fix the man pages. This certainly will be done in 0.3.0
#24799: Some suggestions for the apt method in dselect
 Summary: Wants to be able to specifiy -d from dselect
 Status: Likely a APT_OPTIONS enviornment variable will be created, -d can
         be put there.
	 There is already an APT_CONFIG in 0.3, APT_OPTIONS may also 
	 appear..
	 Use Dselect::Options "-d" and others
#29920: Wish for more verbosity on "has no installation candidate"
 Summary: More reports
 Status: Already fixed in .3
#29382: apt: apt deletes packages after installation without any question
 Summary: Obvois.
 Status: Fixed in .3, use Dselect::Clean "prompt"
#30027: apt: version comparison bug
 Summary: Version compare differs from dpkg
 Status: Fixed in all CVS versions.
#30260: apt: wishlist: do not return to main menu without prompting for return
 Summary: Wants to prompt after dselect update
 Status: Fixed in v3, use dselect::promptafterupdate "true";
#29441: documenting the codes for -s
 Summary: Apparently the simulation output is not immediately obvois
 Status: Someone should update the man page.
#24685: HTTP Proxy cache refresh
 Summary: Some caches hold onto the package index file for too long
 Status: It may be possible to insert the proper header to disable
         caching but I can't think how to do this while allowing
	 the cache to return cached objects - in effect it would
	 completely disable the cache which may not be desired.
         APT now sends a max age header. See the apt.conf(5)
#28172: HTTP Proxy cache refresh should be forced for corrupted packages
 Summary: Some problem resulted in a corrupted package
 Status: I belive this reflects a deeper problem and the suggested solution
         is only a band-aide patch. I intend to close this bug when #24685
	 is fixed with a configuration directive.
	 Use -o acquire::http::no-cache=true
#29351: poor error message after conffile update
 Summary: APT errors when the package file is not found
 Status: The new APT warns better and the error is not fatal
#30112: apt: internal error in apt
 Summary: APT gives an unclear error when it cannot correct dependencies
 Status: Error is clearer
#30324: apt-get lying about file dates in /var/state/apt/lists
 Summary: Doesn't copy the file dates right with file URIs
 Status: Fixed in v3
#30383: apt: dist-upgrade msg "E: Internal error, ScoredFix generated breaks."
 Summary: libc6 maddness causes bizzar problems
 Status: Fixed in v3 
#29983: apt: Wrong diagnostic, could be better
 Summary: It doesn't explicy say you should be root
 Status: Fixed in v3
#22892: Apt improvements
 Summary: Bails if an index file can't be found
 Status: Fixed in v3
#28184: apt could be smarter regarding mirrors
 Summary: Make use of redundant sources
 Status: 0.3.0 will likely do this, already the information for it is stored.
#27646: Apt: dpkg --merge-avail
 Summary: Suggestion to call merge avail after each update operation
 Status: Unlikely. The dpkg --print-avail functions should be obsoleted
         by the apt-query program which should be written.
         Use the dselect script, alias or something.
#26663: rsync file access
 Status: Unlikely, rsync does not provide the necessary support to be
         a terribly good method. I do not intend any 'split mode' 
	 support (ie a way to get Package files via rsync and .debs
	 via http) 
#27100: apt: Better support for project/experimental
 Status: GUI Feature - Version selection and pinning
         Honors the NotAutomatic flag
#30643: base: apt-get update problems with http-/ftp-caches (i.e. squid)
 Status: Fixed as best I can. Try the Acquire::http::No-Cache option.

-- Silly things
#26592: apt: Problems with ftpd in SunOS 5.6
#29903: apt-get insists onto sending a SIZE command
 Summary: SunOS ftpd does not support the SIZE command
 Status: Probably not worth fixing
#20723: Apt suggestion
 Summary: Package Grouping Mechanism
 Status: Who knows
#22550: apt-get upgrade could configure packages earlier
 Status: Who knows
#23934: apt-get source <package>
#27190: apt: installing source packages (wishlist)
 Status: Impossible to do without an index file for all source archives.
#22551: apt: wish: use dist X iff pkg does not exist in dist Y
 Status: GUI Feature - Version selection and pinning
#30237: apt: 0.1.9 checks dependencies against packages.gz
 Summary: For packages with identical version numbers APT prefers
          to use the archive index files
 Status: Yes it is sorta bad, but there is no reasonable solution.
