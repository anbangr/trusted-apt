# -*- make -*-

# This file configures the default environment for the make system
# The way it works is fairly simple, each module is defined in it's
# own *.mak file. It expects a set of variables to be set to values
# for it to operate as expected. When included the module generates
# the requested rules based on the contents of its control variables.

# This works out very well and allows a good degree of flexibility.
# To accommodate some of the features we introduce the concept of 
# local variables. To do this we use the 'Computed Names' feature of
# gmake. Each module declares a LOCAL scope and access it with,
#   $($(LOCAL)-VAR)
# This works very well but it is important to remember that within
# a rule the LOCAL var is unavailable, it will have to be constructed
# from the information in the rule invocation. For stock rules like 
# clean this is simple, we use a local clean rule called clean/$(LOCAL)
# and then within the rule $(@F) gets back $(LOCAL)! Other rules will
# have to use some other mechanism (filter perhaps?) The reason such
# lengths are used is so that each directory can contain several 'instances'
# of any given module. I notice that the very latest gmake has the concept
# of local variables for rules. It is possible this feature in conjunction
# with the generated names will provide a very powerful solution indeed!

# A build directory is used by default, all generated items get put into
# there. However unlike automake this is not done with a VPATH build
# (vpath builds break the distinction between #include "" and #include <>)
# but by explicitly setting the BUILD variable. Make is invoked from
# within the source itself which is much more compatible with compilation
# environments.
