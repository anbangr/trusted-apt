apt (0.8.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get install pkg/experimental will now not only switch the
    candidate of package pkg to the version from the release experimental
    but also of all dependencies of pkg if the current candidate can't
    satisfy a versioned dependency.

apt (0.7.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Already included in the last version but now with better documentation
    is the possibility to add/prefer different compression types while
    downloading archive information, which can decrease the time needed for
    update on slow machines. See apt.conf (5) manpage for details.
  * APT manages his manpage translations now with po4a, thanks to Nicolas
    Fran√ßois and Kurasawa Nozomu, who also provide the ja translation.
    Thanks to Christian Perrier we have already a fr translation and
    a few more are hopefully added in the near future.
  * This version also introduces some _experimental_ configuration options
    to make more aggressive use of dpkg's triggers. If you want to help
    testing these _experimental_ options see apt.conf (5) manpage.

apt (0.7.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code that determines which proxy to use was changed. Now
    'Acquire::{http,ftp}::Proxy[::<host>]' options have the highest priority,
    and '{http,ftp}_proxy' environment variables are used only if options
    mentioned above are not specified.

apt (0.6.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB_BTREE instead of DB_HASH. 
    If you use a database created by an older version of apt, delete 
    it and allow it to be recreated the next time.

apt (0.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB version 4.2.  If used with a
    database created by an older version of apt, an attempt will be made
    to upgrade the database, but this may not work in all cases.  If your
    database is not automatically upgraded, delete it and allow it to be
    recreated the next time.
